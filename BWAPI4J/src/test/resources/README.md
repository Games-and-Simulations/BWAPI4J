# BWAPI4J Test Resources

### Dummy Data

* Dummy data for tests have now been compressed into `*.tar.gz` archives. The entry `*.txt` has been added to the BWAPI4J `.gitignore`. To use the dummy data in the tests, the dummy data archives must first be manually decompressed.
  * [ ] TODO: Create a solution (gradle task, bash/batch script, etc.) to automatically decompress the dummy data when needed.
